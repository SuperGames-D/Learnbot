# Learnbot
A simple AI bot that learns entirely from user input.


## Use Learnbot
Visit [the Learnbot website](https://supergames-d.github.io/learnbot) to chat with Learnbot.
However, this AI is not trained, and you have to teach it yourself. So, you can enter any text in the `Teach` box. You should enter multiple sentences with information.

For example, you can enter the text bellow:
```
Learnbot is a simple AI bot.
SuperGames- is a developer.
```

After that, you can ask questions about it, such as `Who is SuperGames-?` or `What is Learnbot?`. Learnbot will always reply using the same sentences given (This is being worked on).

Feel free to experiment with many different prompts!

## Models
As Learnbot was improved, new models were created. Opening the Learnbot website will (probably) open the most recent one. You can add `?model=` and a model at the end of the url to choose a different one. For instance, `?model=v01` will use the first version of Learnbot.

## Experimental features
- You can say `/learn [text]` to automatically teach the bot.
- The command `/learn math` can also be used to give Learnbot the ability to do simple math. You can ask questions such as `2+2` (number only go up to 100).
- Synonyms: certain words are changed to their synonyms.
